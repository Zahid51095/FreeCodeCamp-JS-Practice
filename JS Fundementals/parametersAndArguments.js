// arameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.



function functionWithArgs(param1, param2) {
    console.log(param1+param2);
  }
