// In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===). Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.

// If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion, and then evaluate the values. However, the strict equality operator will compare both the data type and value as-is, without converting one type to the other.

function compareEquality(a, b) {
    if (a === b) { // Change this line
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  
  compareEquality(10, "10");
